For the NS LAB 

To run the c code the command is :  gcc -o s1 filename.c
                                    ./s1
                                    OR
                                    gcc filename.c
                                    ./a.out


To run python code the command is : python3 filename.py

To open the VSCode and to run the files those should be as same as that of WSL for that we use from root : cd /mnt/where the code file is present 
this is to run the files of client and server on the same machine 
                               

ALWAYS RUN THE SERVER FIRST

AND replace the ip of server in client code
